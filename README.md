## INTERACTIVE KNOWLEDGE HUB FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (Georgia Institute of Technology) 

### Project Background
The RCE (Regional Center of Expertise) Greater Atlanta - of which the Greenhouse Accelerator (a 501c3 organization) is a member - supports the implementation of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals at the regional level through education and training.

The purpose of the project - the Interactive Knowledge Hub - is to provide individuals with the resources they need to foster the change of current practices (in schools, colleges, businesses and government) away from "business as usual" towards the kind of sustainable practices that lead to inclusive development. These individuals - the users of the Interactive Knowledge Hub - can be students in schools/colleges and their teachers/professors, graduates who are now in jobs at for-profit and non-profit organizations, public servants in government functions.

### Expected Deliverables

The web-based Knowledge Hub provides an interactive experience to users through visualization tools that display data in an organized and clean dashboard. There are additional opportunities to improve the hub using Machine Learning - from learning about the specific interests of the users based on their navigation activities to hierarchical multi-label categorization of user input data.
